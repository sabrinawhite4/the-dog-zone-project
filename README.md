# the-dog-zone-project

Have you ever seen a cute picture of a dog and wondered what breed it was? Well now you can find out! 

The dog zone is a webapp that will predict the breed of a dog when a photo of a dog is uploaded to the webapp. 

The public link to this web app: https://the-dog-zone.herokuapp.com/

Welcome to my webapp as you can see there is already a default dog. What you’ll do first is find a picture of your dog or download a dog photo from google. Upload that photo into the webapp. Once the photo has been uploaded it will replace the dog currently on screen and the computer will self learn and provide a prediction as to what they believe the breed is.

Once that breed has shown up you can click name suggestions, you will receive an alert that tells you they are grabbing a name for you out of the array I created with about 20 different names. If you do not like this name and feel it doesn’t match the dog, click ‘No!” it will generate a new name for you! It will continue to do so until you’ve clicked “Yes!”

Once you’ve clicked “Yes” the buttons will then disable as you have now named your cute internet pup! To enable the buttons again you will need  to upload a new dog to the web app and do the process over again! You can also refresh the page, but that will bring you back to the default toy poodle.

The languages/frameworks I used were Javascript, Express, Cors, TensorFlow (machine learning), HTML, CSS, and I used TensorFlow for API. I didn’t use much when it came to databases and other technologies.
